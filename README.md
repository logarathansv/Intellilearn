#IntelliLearn: AI-Driven Adaptive Learning System for Personalized Education

Traditional learning systems follow a one-size-fits-all approach, often failing to cater to the diverse learning needs of students. Some learners struggle with complex topics, while others find the content too easy, leading to disengagement and ineffective learning. The challenge is to develop an Adaptive Learning System that personalizes learning paths based on individual performance, engagement, and progress.

The system should analyze studentsâ€™ responses, accuracy, and time spent on questions to dynamically adjust their difficulty levels. Using machine learning models like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors, the system will predict the optimal next question or topic for a student. The goal is to provide real-time, data-driven recommendations that enhance learning efficiency and retention.

Key objectives include:

Automated difficulty adjustment: Assigning questions based on prior accuracy and progress.
Performance prediction: Forecasting student proficiency using past responses.
Personalized feedback: Identifying weak areas and suggesting targeted learning materials.
This adaptive system can revolutionize e-learning platforms, competitive exam preparation, and skill-based training by ensuring a tailored learning experience for every user. Your task is to build a robust model that effectively predicts learning paths and optimizes educational outcomes. ðŸš€
